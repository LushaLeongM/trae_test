## HTML Introduction

This project is a modern, mobile-first website for a daily habit tracker app called HabitForge. The HTML structure is organized into several key sections:

### Document Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- Meta tags and title -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content sections -->
    <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Key Sections

1. **Hero Section**: The main header that introduces the app with a compelling headline and call-to-action button.
   ```html
   <header class="hero">
       <h1>Transform Your Day, One Habit at a Time</h1>
       <p class="hero-subtext">Build life-changing routines with our science-backed habit tracking system</p>
       <button class="cta-button">Download Now</button>
   </header>
   ```

2. **Feature Sections**: Highlights the app's key features with alternating layouts for visual interest.
   ```html
   <section class="feature left-image">
       <div class="feature-content">
           <h2>Visual Progress Tracking</h2>
           <p>See your streak calendar light up with every completed habit...</p>
       </div>
       <svg class="feature-image" viewBox="0 0 400 300"><!-- SVG content --></svg>
   </section>
   ```

3. **Call-to-Action (CTA) Section**: Final section encouraging users to take action.
   ```html
   <section class="cta-final">
       <h2>Ready to Change Your Life?</h2>
       <button class="cta-button">Start Your Journey Now</button>
   </section>
   ```

### Mobile-First Approach

The HTML is structured with a mobile-first approach, using CSS grid and media queries to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. The design starts with a single-column layout for mobile devices and expands to a two-column grid for larger screens.

## Git Version Control

### Repository Setup

These commands were used to initialize and push the repository:

```bash
# Create a README file with initial content
echo "# trae_test" >> README.md

# Initialize a new Git repository in the current directory
git init

# Stage the README file for commit
git add README.md

# Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "first commit"

# Rename the default branch to 'main'
git branch -M main

# Add a remote repository URL with the name 'origin'
git remote add origin https://github.com/LushaLeongM/trae_test.git

# Push the local 'main' branch to the remote repository and set up tracking
git push -u origin main
```

### Common Git Operations

#### Working with Branches

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Switch to an existing branch
git checkout main

# List all branches (local and remote)
git branch -a

# Delete a branch after merging
git branch -d feature/new-feature
```

#### Updating Your Repository

```bash
# Get the latest changes from the remote repository
git pull origin main

# View the status of your working directory
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline
```

#### Merging Changes

```bash
# Merge a feature branch into main
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-feature

# If there are conflicts, resolve them and then:
git add <resolved-files>
git commit -m "Merge feature/new-feature with conflict resolution"
```

#### Best Practices

1. **Commit Messages**: Write clear, concise commit messages that explain what changes were made and why.
2. **Small Commits**: Make small, focused commits that address a single issue or feature.
3. **Pull Before Push**: Always pull the latest changes before pushing to avoid conflicts.
4. **Branching Strategy**: Use feature branches for new development and bug fixes to keep the main branch stable.
5. **Code Review**: Have team members review code through pull requests before merging into the main branch.
