"Build a modern, mobile-first website for a daily habit tracker app. It should have 5 sections: (1) a hero with a bold headline like “Transform Your Day, One Habit at a Time,” a short paragraph explaining the app, and a large “Download Now” button; (2-4) three alternating screenshot sections. First with image left/text right, then right/left, then left/right, each with a header and description highlighting a key app feature. (5) a final CTA section with a strong headline like “Ready to Change Your Life?”, supporting text, another download button, and trust elements like app ratings, user count, or testimonials. Keep the design clean, fast, and conversion-focused. For the copy, use expert copywriting techniques, proven methods and frameworks, triggering powerful emotional responses that compel the user to download the app and finally live the life they always dreamt of. For images, generate mockup SVGs when needed. Use only static HTML, CSS and JS. Do not install any packages, do NOT use Typescript, keep it as simple as possible. I am not a coder, and I just want to get a website up for my app."
